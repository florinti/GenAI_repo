This script defines a news-aware question-answering API using FastAPI that:

üîç Scrapes content from the BBC News website, indexes it using vector embeddings, and allows natural language querying via a /query endpoint.
üß† Core Features:
1. Scraping + Indexing
Target: https://www.bbc.com/news

Depth-controlled crawler that recursively follows internal links (depth=2 by default).

Cleans and stores paragraph-level chunks using SentenceTransformer embeddings.

Chunks are stored in ChromaDB, a persistent vector database.

2. Query Pipeline
A query goes through:

Embedding-based retrieval (with all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Re-ranking using CrossEncoder (ms-marco-TinyBERT)

Top results are formatted into a prompt.

3. LLM-Powered Response
A prompt is constructed using:

Retrieved chunks (short-term memory)

Prior relevant conversation history (long-term memory)

Immediate previous turn (short-term memory)

Sent to Ollama LLM (e.g., LLaMA2) running locally (http://localhost:11434)

Response is cleaned and returned as an answer.

4. Memory Management
A JSON file history.json stores all Q&A pairs.

Embedding similarity is used to retrieve the most relevant prior topic for contextual memory.

Both long-term and short-term memory are explicitly injected into the prompt.

  "answer": "Based on the provided context, it is possible to draw some conclusions about the influence of Donald Trump on Australian politics. The passage mentions that Dutton, who is the leader of the opposition in Australia, was seen by many as the country's version of Trump. This suggests that there are similarities between the two politicians, such as their populist and nationalist rhetoric. However, the passage also indicates that Australians do not appear to want a political leader like Trump, which suggests that there may be some resistance to this type of politics in Australia. Therefore, based on the context provided, it can be concluded that while there may be some similarities between Trump and Dutton, Australians do not seem to be embracing the same type of populist and nationalist politics as seen in the United States.",

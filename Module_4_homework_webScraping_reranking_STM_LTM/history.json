      "query": "Is Australia's politics influenced by Trump?",
      "answer": "Based on the provided context, it is possible to draw some conclusions about the influence of Donald Trump on Australian politics. The passage mentions that Dutton, who is the leader of the opposition in Australia, was seen by many as the country's version of Trump. This suggests that there are similarities between the two politicians, such as their populist and nationalist rhetoric. However, the passage also indicates that Australians do not appear to want a political leader like Trump, which suggests that there may be some resistance to this type of politics in Australia. Therefore, based on the context provided, it can be concluded that while there may be some similarities between Trump and Dutton, Australians do not seem to be embracing the same type of populist and nationalist politics as seen in the United States.",
